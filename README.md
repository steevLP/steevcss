# what is steevcss
SteevCSS is like the name says a CSS Framework!
This Framework is optimized and maintained for my usecases and my usecases only please keep that in mind when reporting anything..

# what steevcss not is
It is not maintained by a big team like bootstrap is if you want a professional librarie you won't need to debug as much as mine. then dont use it

# disclaymer
it can happen that things from one second to another change entirely it will be documented somwhere
i am not offering much support and only documentation i can fully understand.

# My GitHub todolist
creating documentation

i am updating this Readme on the fly so it may change as the librarie does
